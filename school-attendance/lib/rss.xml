 <br><br>Some stress or feeling anxious is normal. Young people can feel uneasy about going to school after a short time away. For some, their worries about school can be so overwhelming to the point that it feels impossible to attend school. <br><br><br><img alt="Content/attachments/Pasted image 20250410190634.png" src="https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/lib/media/pasted-image-20250410190634.png"><br>

How stress causes anxiety and avoidance exacerbates anxiety.
<br><br><img alt="NICABM-InfoG-window-of-tolerance.jpg" src="https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/lib/media/nicabm-infog-window-of-tolerance.jpg"><br>The window of tolerance describes our nervous system’s capacity to handle stress while staying focused and present. When we are within this window, we can effectively respond to everyday stressors without feeling overwhelmed.<br>However, as stress grows or occurs over long periods, we tend to get upset over even the smallest things. This is because our window of tolerance shrinks, which makes it harder to stay within and manage challenges calmly. Eventually, as stress exceeds what we can handle, we become overwhelmed and leave this window - this is our body's way of protecting us. It takes over control and may react in one of two ways:<br>
<br>fight or run away (i.e. hyperarousal), appearing as anxiety, panic, fear, anger, irritation
<br>shut down (i.e. hypoarousal), appearing as numb, frozen, low energy, disconnected.
<br>Young people who experience school attendance challenges may have had these reactions previously and may avoid school so as not to relieve these feelings.<br><br>The larger our window of tolerance, the more we can handle without becoming dysregulated. We can reduce the amount of stress, or improve our ability to cope with stress.<br>Size can be affected by experiences of trauma and neurodivergence.<br><br><br>
<br>Stressful school events and situations (e.g. fire drills, unexpected tests, reading aloud in front of the class, incursions, excursions)
<br>Sudden changes in routines (e.g. a replacement teacher)
<br>Uncertainty about rules and instructions (e.g. break times, new activities or equipment)
<br>Transitions between tasks and lessons
<br>Academic and sports performance expectations
<br>Changing uniforms, loud noises
<br>Access barriers
<br><br>There are many signs of anxiety about school. Some signs are obvious, others can be subtle and may include:<br>
<br>crying or yelling related to going to school
<br>difficulty falling asleep the night before school
<br>frequent health complaints, such as stomach aches, headaches, dizziness, racing heart
<br>repeated requests to go home from school
<br>pleading or bargaining to stay home 
<br>Signs of anxiety may be present every day during the school term, or only appear or worsen on some days of the week. This may include:<br>
<br>fixed duration during the week (e.g. all PE or math classes, a certain teacher is in-charge)
<br>occasional days (e.g. before tests or exams, school excursions)
<br>See <a data-href="signs-of-attendance-challenges" href="https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/content/2-slipping-attendance/signs-of-attendance-challenges.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">signs-of-attendance-challenges</a>.<br>Coping with anxiety about school
School reluctance or refusal problems are usually driven by a child’s attempt to cope with overwhelming difficulties rather than disobedience or defiance.
<br><br>Avoiding situations and places that make young people feel more anxious helps them to cope with their worries and emotions. Avoidance actually makes anxiety worse in the long term. So, allowing children to avoid school is likely to make their anxiety about school worse.<br>Instead, the best approach to anxiety is to gradually face our fears with appropriate support, even though this is daunting. Let your child know that some anxiety or difficulties at school are normal and to be expected. Reassure them that you are confident in their ability to face their fears. <a data-href="manage-worries" href="https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/content/3-refusing-school/manage-worries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">manage-worries</a><br><br>Inform school staff of your child’s anxiety about school, as it may be hard for them to recognise them.<br>Identify any triggers for your child’s anxiety by asking their teachers if there are particular times that they find more challenging (e.g., during lesson changeovers, break times, particular subjects, the journey to school or throughout the day). <a data-href="raise-your-concerns" href="https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/content/2-slipping-attendance/raise-your-concerns.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">raise-your-concerns</a><br>Work with the school to minimise potential stressful events (e.g. unexpected tests, reading aloud in front of the class). <a data-href="collaborate-with-schools-and-others" href="https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/content/3-refusing-school/collaborate-with-schools-and-others.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">collaborate-with-schools-and-others</a><br><br><br>
<br>Use evidence-based self-help resources, such as websites or books about managing anxiety (e.g. Health to Health)
<br>The BRAVE program is an evidence-based Australian online program designed for young people (ages 3 to 17) and their parents to prevent and treat anxiety.
<br>Learn relaxation strategies. The Raising Children Network has guides on using breathing exercises, muscle relaxation and mindfulness activities with children to manage anxiety.
<br>Involve young people in recognising and responding to signs of anxiety can increase their autonomy and confidence. They can use guided tools, either independently or with a trusted adult, to reflect on the triggers for their anxiety, signs that they are feeling anxious and when their anxiety escalates, and strategies that may help them. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://allplaylearn.org.au/resource/recognising-and-supporting-child-student-anxiety-form/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://allplaylearn.org.au/resource/recognising-and-supporting-child-student-anxiety-form/" target="_blank">Recognising and supporting student anxiety forms</a>
<br>With appropriate support, children can learn to manage their anxiety about school, gradually face their fears and return to school. Keep in mind that even when school attendance improves, your child’s anxiety may persist for some time because they are confronting their fears.]]></description><link>https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/content/3-refusing-school/stress-and-anxiety.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Content/3 Refusing school/stress-and-anxiety.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Chan]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 07:36:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/lib/media/pasted-image-20250410190634.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://emilytofu.github.io/school-attendance/lib/media/pasted-image-20250410190634.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alternative learning options]]></title><description><![CDATA[
